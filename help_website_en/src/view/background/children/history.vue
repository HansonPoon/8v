        <p>Bwin--, founded in 2006 and known as betandwin--, has 12 employees in 1997. One year after its founding, the company launched its first online gambling website, focusing on the growing sports gambling market. One of the most important developments in the company's history is the introduction of its in-house real-time betting product, which allows players to bet on sports events when actual events occur. The company's initial public offering on the Austria stock exchange was held in March 2000. In June 2001, Beandwin acquired Simon Bold (Gibraltar), now known as Bwin International Limited, and basically transferred its business to Gibraltar. The move is to follow the company's biggest competitors to the British overseas territories. By December 2001, betandwin was ready to enter the online casino game market and achieve that goal by launching its first casino platform. Two years later, in July 2003, betandwin launched and launched a soft gaming platform called Balls of Fire.

        <p>In November 2004, betandwin launched a multiplayer poker game. The Group acquired betoto.Com in June 2005 to expand its market share in Greece, offering fixed-odds bets to serve global bettors. December of the same year marked another major takeover of --Ongame e-Solutions AB. After the acquisition of Ongame-Solutions, renamed Bwin Games, the acquisition is in line with the group's strategy to expand into the poker market. In 2005, Bedwin won the global media rights of the German Football League outside Germany. In August 2006, betandwin launched a new Bwin brand. This is in the discovery that the betandwin brand, described as "descriptive, advanced and functional," is no longer suitable for the company's wide range of entertainment products (including sports betting, poker, soft games) and Casino games. In 2007, Bwin began offering live broadcast of major sporting events. In September 2009, Bwin announced the acquisition of Italian poker operator Gioco Digitale, marking the company's entry into the Italian online gambling market.</p>
